# ue5-camera-mocap

### An experiment to see if it is possible to use an Android phone to capture camera translation data, and then send it to unreal. I am making this because all the other alternatives cost absurd amounts of money for individual developers, and a phone and camera are something that most (if not all) Unreal Engine animators have.

### This is still a work in progress! More will come to the README as this project progresses.

*This is the current progress of the setup. Yaw and pitch are completed (roll, and XYZ movement are still left to work on).*
